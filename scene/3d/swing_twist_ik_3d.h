// Whole-body, swing-twist-DIRECT IK -- a concrete IterateIK3D solver, so it is a drop-in for
// FABRIK3D/CCDIK3D and reuses the same chains / targets / per-joint Kusudama limitations.
// Unlike the per-chain solvers, it overrides the whole-body pass: each chain's end bone is a
// 6D effector (its target frame's forward = position heading -> SWING, a second axis ->
// TWIST), and every bone is rotated by a global multi-limb Kabsch best-fit over ALL its
// downstream effector position headings at once (the coupling FABRIK can't do), then twist is
// solved about the resulting forward as its own 1-DOF objective. The modular kusudama clamps
// swing (cones) and twist ([twist_from, twist_to]) in its native coordinates.

	// Everything an animator needs maps onto knobs IterateIK3D already provides -- no bespoke API:
	//  - a PIN is just a bone with a target (a chain's target_node); the chain end is pinned by it,
	//  - a parentless PINNED ROOT is the motion root: it translates to its target automatically
	//    (rotating ancestors can't aim a parentless bone), so no "free root" flag,
	//  - a LOCKED bone is per-joint stiffness 1.0 (the rotation block slerps by 1 - stiffness, so
	//    stiffness 1 keeps the FK pose); a soft lock is any stiffness in between.

	// Per-JOINT weights, stored the IterateIK3D way: in the chain settings, exposed as
	// settings/i/joints/j/priorities (+ stiffness/engage/isolation/relax) via the
	// _get_joint_extra_properties hook + _set/_get (so they persist + undo like the per-joint
	// limitation). position scales how hard the solver pulls that bone to its target point (weighted
	// Kabsch); swing/twist scale how hard it matches the target BASIS (the "star"). A POLE is not a
	// special case -- it is a low-position, zero-orientation weight on a mid joint (elbow/knee) that
	// also has a target: the strong wrist owns the reach, so the weak elbow can only influence the
	// leftover roll DOF, swinging the elbow toward its target.
	// Per-joint solver weights -- the EWBIK PST (position/swing/twist) priorities plus stiffness.
	// position scales the pull to the target point; swing scales matching the target's forward
	// AXIS; twist scales matching its ROLL about that axis (swing + twist = the orientation
	// "star", split into its two physical DOF). stiffness is how much the bone resists rotating.
